                    <h3>Early Life & Exile</h3>
                    <p>Born on December 5, 1999 a.t.b. as the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire, Lelouch is the son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and Empress Marianne vi Britannia. At age 10, his world shatters: Marianne is assassinated, and his sister Nunnally is blinded and crippled. Exiled to Japan as political pawns, Lelouch adopts the alias Lelouch Lamperouge, attending Ashford Academy while nursing a burning hatred for the Empire that betrayed his family.</p>

                <div class="bio-subsection">
                    <h3>Rise as Zero</h3>
                    <p>Japan's invasion by Britannia in 2010 a.t.b. ignites his resolve. Meeting the immortal witch C.C., he receives the Power of the Kings—Geass, the ability to command absolute obedience. Masked as Zero, he forms the Black Knights, a terrorist cell turned revolutionary force. His unparalleled intellect turns guerrilla tactics into grand strategy, liberating Japan (now Area 11) and toppling corrupt nobles.</p>

                <div class="bio-subsection">
                    <h3>Emperor & Zero Requiem</h3>
                    <p>Ascending as the 99th Emperor after a coup, Lelouch enforces a tyrannical peace to unite the world against him. The Zero Requiem—his ultimate gambit—culminates in a staged assassination by his friend Suzaku (as Zero), sacrificing himself to end global hatred and forge lasting unity. Revived via C.C.'s Code, he wanders as L.L., a humbled guardian against rogue Geass.</p>

                <div class="bio-subsection">
                    <h3>Legacy</h3>
                    <p>Lelouch embodies the anti-hero: arrogant yet selfless, ruthless yet visionary. His rebellion exposes imperialism's rot, proving one mind can reshape destiny. Themes of power's corruption, familial love, and moral ambiguity define his eternal impact on anime and philosophy.</p>
